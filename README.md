## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Create `train-tracker` and `train-tracker-test` databases on PostgreSQL database.
4. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5. If you navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), you should see some UI already :)
6. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`
